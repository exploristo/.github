# Exploristo

## Exploristo is an open, editor-driven platform for exploring places, destinations, and routes through structured geographic and semantic data.

It is a data-first system that connects localities, places, POIs, collections, and routes into a coherent knowledge system that can power maps, guides, recommendations, and editorial content.
